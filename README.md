# RoboFriends-app

A fun front-end React app that displays a friends list with a search function. 

The app fetches a list of users from the JSON placeholder API and then populates the page with user cards. For the user cards, the robohash API is used to fetch and display a random robot image for each user. The result can then be searched using the search field, which will match the user input to the user names.

Created with ReactJS, CSS & Robohash API, styled with Tachyons.
